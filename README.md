Link for view final version https://revan-darth.github.io/Revan-Darth.project-15.github.io/ The header and transitions to other pages work, the buttons for checking the auto also work

Buttons work in the site navigation with a transition to other pages, there are also similar buttons at the bottom of the site (footer). The 'Archive Pods' button works on the main page. The 'Details' buttons work. Clicking on the search button will take you to the search result page. There is a 404 page, to see it you need to add 404.html to the address bar
